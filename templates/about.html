    <p>
      I am a Portland based UX/UI Designer and Strategist. I offer experience in
      UX/UI design, small business strategy, marketing, sales, and customer
      support. Concepting how to utilize finite temporal and financial resources
      to maximize a small company’s potential has been a large part of my young
      career. Now, I am looking forward to applying the same principles to
      designing digital experiences.<br /><br />

      In my personal time, I enjoy playing with my dogs, snowboarding, reading,
      and working on personal projects.

      I was born and raised in Los Angeles. In 2015, I moved to the Pacific
      Northwest to attend

      I received my B.A. in History from Reed in 2018, after I completed a
      year-long independent project on the history of America’s federal
      narcotics laws. (If you're interested, I'm happy to talk about this
      anytime!)

      That subsequent fall, I was hired as the second employee at a local SaaS
      start-up. Being such a small company, I had the unique opportunity to take
      on many roles, but I quickly discovered a passion for UX/UI strategy and
      design. Now, I am working hard to expand my knowledge and concept creative
      solutions that are useful to everyone.
