    <h2>2. Picking Ethical Projects</h2>
    <p>
        As a designer, I reserve the right to decline any projects that I believe contradict my moral or ethical codes. 
        I will not work on projects that I believe will have an obvious negative impact on my community or the greater world.

    <h2>3. Accepting My Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        As a human and a designer, I believe it is important to remember that my experience is limited to my point of view. 
        There are thousands of unique perspectives and it is important to keep an open mind and seek out  varying viewpoints
         throughout the design process.

      <h2>4. Protecting Data</h2>
      <p>
          As a designer, I will always work hard to safeguard my user’s data.  
          I will always be honest and upfront about when and how data is being used.

      <h2>5. Respectful Criticism</h2>
      <p>
        When my work is critiqued, I will not take criticisms personally and I will always listen to others’
        ideas on how I can improve. <br><br>
        When critiquing other designers work, I will always be respectful of the person and the
        effort that they put into their projects. I will not be intentionally cruel and I will
        always include an explanation to back up any critique I make.
