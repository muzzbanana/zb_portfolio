  <div class="project-brief">
    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of Ink Envy, was to create a mobile app that makes it easier for
      tattoo artists and customers to connect. The app will make use of social
      media, have a reliable review system, a simple but extensive searching
      capability, a scheduling and messaging feature, and a way to explore new
      and trending artists. Additionally, it will appeal to travelling artists
      and customers, a widely underserved market.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="my-role">
    <h2>My role</h2>
    <p>
      Ink Envy was an entirely independent project. I was responsible for
      everything from researching the competitive market, to designing the
      finished user interface. I conducted research, strategized effective
      solutions, designed the interface, and conducted user testing with my
      target audience at multiple stages.<br /><br />

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Tattoos are incredibly popular - 36% of 18-25 year olds and 40% of 36-40
      year old have tattoos. It is a 1.65 billion dollar business in America.
      The challenge was to create an app that helps users explore inspiration
      for tattoos, connect with artists, and increase customer satisfaction.

    <h1>Competitive Research</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I began the project by conducting extensive research into the existing
      market of tattoo related apps and quickly discovered two important direct
      competitors - InkHunter and Tattoodo. Then, I analyzed these apps and
      their market presence in order to strategize ways Ink Envy could stand out
      by offering solutions to unmet needs.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="top-competitors">
    <h2>InkHunter</h2>
    <p>
      An augmented reality app that allows users to test tattoo ideas in real
      time through their phone’s camera.<br /><br />
      While the AR portion of InkHunter works very well and is simple to learn,
      the app lacks some major features that limits the user’s experience.<br /><br />
      For example, the app advertises that users can follow artists, but this
      simply redirects users to the artist’s Instagram page. Additionally, the
      app prompts to browse as either guests or account holders, however it
      restricts guests from then creating an account unless the app is
      re-downloaded.<br /><br />
    </p>

  <div class="tattoodo">
    <div class="tattoodo-text">
      <h2>Tattoodo</h2>
      <p>
        A large desktop and mobile platform that helps tattoo artists display
        their work and connect with customers. Over 300,000 artists have signed
        up to display their work on Tattoodo and they have raised over $15
        million in funding since 2013.<br /><br />
        Tattoodo’s strengths lie in its booking platform. It is the only tattoo
        focused app that allows users to connect and book appointments with
        artists in-app.<br /><br />
        However, the app has some significant usability problems. For one, the
        app also does not allow users to search by location and style at the
        same time, which my research has shown to be an important feature for
        users.<br /><br />
        Moreover, the overall aesthetic of the app feels dated and lacks an
        aesthetically pleasing user interface.<br /><br />

      My user research research began with conducting interviews with those in
      my network that fit the demographic I was targeting, people who either had
      tattoos or had an interest in getting them. This process gave me insights
      into existing tattoo apps and users’ needs, goals, and frustrations. Using
      this data, I created an affinity map, multiple user personas and journeys
      for both customers and artists. I created personas that were reflective of
      the wide range of experiences, perspectives and abilities of my audience
      to best serve users.

      I turned those hand drawings into high fidelity wireframes using Sketch.

    <p>
      Using my high fidelity prototype, I developed a usability test to see how
      easily people within my target audience could complete specific tasks
      within the app. All of the tests took place in person and lasted between
      10-20 minutes.<br /><br />
      I also ran an online A/B preference test with 20 volunteers to discover if
      users preferred a dark or light theme.

      I conducted 6 usability tests. All tests were done in person, on my
      personal computer, with an offline version of my app. All tests were
      recorded using Cloud.io screen recording software.
    </p>

  <div class="a-b-testing-results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      After conducting the usability tests, I found 2 high priority usability
      issues with my design, 2 medium priority issues, and 1 low priority issue.
      Users struggled to get to their messaging inbox from their Appointments
      screen and they thought the messaging icon I chose was confusing. Both of
      these issues, along with many more, were fixed in the final updates.

    <p>
      Once I had finished conducting my usability tests, organizing the data,
      and ranking the errors by their level of severity, I began to refine the
      final designs for Ink Envy. This involved making significant changes to
      the artist’s profile page, changing icons, and adjusting small details to
      increase the accessibility of the app.

          I changed the Suggested Artists menu to a Past Appointments menu to
