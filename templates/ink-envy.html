        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>Ink Envy was the second app I created as a part of the Career Foundry UX Immersion course.
        The initial idea was to help tattoo enthusiasts find inspiration for their next tattoo, but
        after conducting extensive research and interviewing a sample of my user demographic, the app
        expanded to include many features around traveling for both customers and artists.<br><br>
        Using Ink Envy, tattoo enthusiasts can stay up to date with their favorite artistsâ€™ work,
        book appointments, save photos for later inspiration, and opt in for notifications about
        traveling tattoo artists.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-role">
        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>Ink Envy was an entirely independent project. I was responsible for everything from researching
            the competitive market, to designing the finished user interface. I conducted research,
            strategized effective solutions, designed the the interface, and conducted user testing with
            my target audience at multiple stages.<br><br></p>

    <div class="the-challenge">
        <h1>The Challenge</h1>
        <p>Tattoos are incredibly popular - 36% of 18-25 year olds and 40% of 36-40 year old have tattoos.
           It is a 1.65 billion dollar business in America. The challenge was to create an app that helps
           users explore inspiration for tattoos, connect with artists, and reduce regret.</p>

    <div class="the-problem">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>People in the market for new tattoos need a reliable way to discover and connect with
            tattoo artists in their area, so they can find inspiration and schedule appointments
            with ease. We will know this to be true when we see how many users sign up to use the
            app and how many artists opt in to display their portfolios on the app.</p>
