    <div class="project-brief">
        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>Ink Envy was the second app I created as a part of the Career Foundry UX Immersion course.
        The initial idea was to help tattoo enthusiasts find inspiration for their next tattoo, but
        after conducting extensive research and interviewing a sample of my user demographic, the app
        expanded to include many features around traveling for both customers and artists.<br><br>
        Using Ink Envy, tattoo enthusiasts can stay up to date with their favorite artists’ work,
        book appointments, save photos for later inspiration, and opt in for notifications about
        traveling tattoo artists.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-role">
        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>Ink Envy was an entirely independent project. I was responsible for everything from researching
            the competitive market, to designing the finished user interface. I conducted research,
            strategized effective solutions, designed the the interface, and conducted user testing with
            my target audience at multiple stages.<br><br></p>

    <div class="the-challenge">
        <h1>The Challenge</h1>
        <p>Tattoos are incredibly popular - 36% of 18-25 year olds and 40% of 36-40 year old have tattoos.
           It is a 1.65 billion dollar business in America. The challenge was to create an app that helps
           users explore inspiration for tattoos, connect with artists, and reduce regret.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>To begin the project, I began conducting extensive research into the existing
            market of Tattoo related apps. During this research I discovered two important
            direct competitors - InkHunter and Tattoodo.  I then began to analyze their
            apps and marketing strategies in order to strategize ways my app could secure a
            place in the market.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="top-competitors">
        <h2>InkHunter</h2>
            A powerful augmented reality app that allows users to use their phone’s camera to
            test tattoo ideas in real time.<br><br>
            While the AR portion of InkHunter works very well and is simple to learn, the app is
            missing some major features that can cause friction in the user experience.<br><br>
            For example, the app advertises that users can “follow” artists, but the follow button
            just redirects users to the artists Instagram page. Even worse, the app allows users to
            continue as guests, but does not allow them to create accounts in app. Meaning, if you
            skip the create account section, you cannot go back and create an account unless you
            delete and re-download the app.<br><br>

        <h2>Tattoodo</h2>
            A large desktop and mobile platform that helps tattoo artists display their work and
            connect with customers. Over 300,000 artists have signed up to display their work on
            Tattoodo and they have raised over $15 million in funding since 2013.<br><br>
            Tattoodo’s strengths lie in it’s booking platform. It is the only Tattoo focused app
            that allows users to connect with real tattoo artists in the app and book appointments
            directly with them.<br><br>
            However, the app has some significant usability problems. For one, the “profile” page’s
            purpose seems unclear and overlaps with the “Saved photos” page. The app also does not
            allow users to search by location and style at the same time, which can cause friction
            with the user experience.<br><br>
            Finally, the overall aesthetic of the app feels antiquated and uninspiring, which means
            the app could be surmounted by an app with a more friendly user experience and a more
            aesthetically pleasing User Interface.<br><br>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Once I had completed my market study, I began researching my target audience by interviewing people
            in my netwok with tattoos or an interest in getting tattoos. This gave me further insights into
            their knowledge of existing apps, their needs, their goals, and their frustrations.  I then began
            to analyze the data by creating an affinity map, three user personas, and two user journeys. Two
            user personas represented Customers or Users and One user Persona represented an Artist as I thought
            it was important to understand both perspectives.</p>

        <p>After a long research process, it was time to begin planning out my app. I started by designing and
            curating a card sorting exercise with a sample of my target audience. Then, I began sketching low fidelity
            wireframes using a notebook and a pen, and finally, I turned those hand drawings into high fidelity

        <p>Once I had finished creating a high fidelity prototype, I began designing a usability test to see how
            easily real people within my target audience could complete specific tasks within the app. All of the
            tests took place in person and lasted between 10-20 minutes.<br><br>
            I also ran an A/B preference test with 20 volunteers to see if users preferred a dark
            or light theme with 20 volunteers.

    <div class="a-b-testing-results">
        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>After conducting 6 usability tests and 1 A/B preference test, I have found 2 high priority usability issues
            with my design,  2 medium priority issues, and 1 low priority issue. Moreover, I have found that users are
            equally in favor of a dark or light theme. While the light theme allows the colors and pictures to “pop”
            more, the dark theme is easier on the eyes and makes the app stand out more. Ideally, I would like to build
            both themes and allow users to switch back and forth, but for now, I will proceed with the dark theme. </p>

        <p>Once I had finished conducting my usability tests, organizing the data, and ranking the errors by their level of

            Artist’s profile pages, changing icons, and adjusting the the contrast on some buttons to increase the
            accessibility of the app.</p>
